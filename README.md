# Human Capital Management App

## The Aim:

I want to create an App that will allow me to add/delete "staff" from a database.

This will be the largest project I've built that will be based off components and connecting to a database.

I will be creating this app in Vue, and using a MongoDB database hosted in the cloud, I will be using a database as a service so I don't have to worry about this part!

## Caveat

I'm not a designer, I haven't used a CCS library as Vue 3 hasn't got much support yet. I will be redisigning the app at a later stage and adding CSS in to make it look awesome!
